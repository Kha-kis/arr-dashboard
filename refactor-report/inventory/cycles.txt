# Circular Dependency Analysis

## Methodology
- Analyzed import chains across the codebase
- Checked for bidirectional dependencies
- Verified layered architecture compliance

## Results: ✓ No Circular Dependencies Detected

The codebase follows a clean unidirectional dependency flow:

### Dependency Layers (Bottom to Top)

1. **Base Layer**
   - @arr/shared (external package)
   - lib/utils.ts
   - components/ui/* (primitives)

2. **API Client Layer**
   - lib/api-client/base.ts (depends on: @arr/shared)
   - lib/api-client/*.ts (depends on: base.ts, @arr/shared)

3. **Hook Layer**
   - hooks/api/*.ts (depends on: api-client/*, @arr/shared, react-query)

4. **Component Layer**
   - components/layout/* (depends on: hooks, ui components, lib/utils)
   - components/auth/* (depends on: hooks, lib/utils)
   - features/*/components/* (depends on: hooks, ui components, lib/utils, @arr/shared)

5. **App Layer**
   - app/*.tsx (depends on: feature components, layout components, providers)

### Validation

✓ No feature imports from features (features are isolated)
✓ No hooks import from components (correct layering)
✓ No API clients import from hooks (correct layering)
✓ No circular imports within layers

### Manual Import Feature (Special Case)

The manual-import feature has internal modules:
- helpers.ts ← store.ts (store depends on helpers)
- types.ts ← store.ts (store depends on types)
- helpers.ts does NOT import store (✓ no cycle)

## Architecture Compliance

The dependency graph follows the intended architecture:

```
app/
  ↓
features/ → components/layout, components/auth
  ↓
hooks/api/
  ↓
lib/api-client/
  ↓
lib/api-client/base.ts
  ↓
@arr/shared (external)
```

All imports flow downward (toward dependencies), none flow upward (toward dependents).

## Recommendation

The current architecture is clean with no circular dependencies. Maintain this by:
1. Continue enforcing unidirectional data flow
2. Keep features isolated (no cross-feature imports)
3. Add ESLint import/no-cycle rule to prevent regressions
