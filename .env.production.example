# Security keys are automatically generated on first run and persisted
# to the Docker volume alongside your database.
#
# However, if you want to provide your own keys (e.g., for backup/restore
# purposes), you can uncomment and set these:
#
# ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-key-here
# SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET=your-secret-here
#
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
