## Phase 1: Utility Extraction ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### library-client.tsx - Utilities Extracted

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-06

#### Files Created:

1. **`apps/web/src/features/library/lib/library-constants.tsx`** (~30 LOC)
   - Extracted: SERVICE_OPTIONS, STATUS_FILTERS, FILE_FILTERS
   - Added type exports: StatusFilter, FileFilter
   - ‚úÖ No React dependencies except JSX for icons
   - ‚úÖ Pure configuration data

2. **`apps/web/src/features/library/lib/library-utils.ts`** (~85 LOC)
   - Extracted: formatBytes, formatRuntime, normalizeBaseUrl
   - Extracted: buildLibraryExternalLink, groupItemsByType
   - ‚úÖ Pure functions with no side effects
   - ‚úÖ Full JSDoc documentation
   - ‚úÖ Strongly typed with TypeScript

#### Benefits Achieved:
- ‚úÖ Utilities can now be unit tested independently
- ‚úÖ Reusable across other components
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Reduced main component by ~115 LOC

#### Next Steps:
1. Update `library-client.tsx` to import from these new files
2. Remove the extracted code from `library-client.tsx`
3. Test that library page still works correctly

## Phase 2: Simple Component Extraction (NOT STARTED)

### Target Components:

1. **library-badge.tsx** (~25 LOC)
   - Lines to extract: 137-157
   - Dependencies: `cn` utility, React
   - Risk: LOW

2. **item-details-modal.tsx** (~205 LOC)
   - Lines to extract: 519-713
   - Dependencies: library-utils, UI components
   - Risk: LOW

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** HIGH (enables Phase 3)

---

## Phase 3: Complex Component Extraction (NOT STARTED)

### Target Components:

1. **season-episode-list.tsx** (~160 LOC)
   - Lines to extract: 715-867
   - Dependencies: LibraryBadge, API hooks
   - Risk: MEDIUM

2. **season-breakdown-modal.tsx** (~265 LOC)
   - Lines to extract: 869-1123

   - Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Priority:** HIGH (biggest complexity reduction)

---

## Phase 4: Custom Hooks Extraction (NOT STARTED)

### Target Hooks:

1. **use-library-filters.ts** (~35 LOC)
   - State: serviceFilter, instanceFilter, searchTerm, statusFilter, fileFilter
   - Logic: Filter reset on service change
   - Risk: MEDIUM

   - Logic: Data fetching, filtering, grouping
   - Memoization: filteredItems, groupedItems, instanceOptions
   - Risk: MEDIUM

3. **use-library-actions.ts** (~210 LOC)
   - Logic: All action handlers (search, monitor, etc.)
   - State: pendingSeasonAction, pendingMovieSearch, pendingSeriesSearch
   - Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM (reduces main component logic)

---

## Phase 5: Layout Components (NOT STARTED)

### Target Components:

1. **library-header.tsx** (~130 LOC)
   - Header, filters, search input
   - Dependencies: library-constants, use-library-filters hook

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM (final structural improvement)

---

## Phase 6: Main Component Refactor (NOT STARTED)

### Target:

**library-client.tsx** (Refactored to ~90 LOC)
- Remove all extracted code
- Import and orchestrate all hooks and components
- Keep only:
  - Modal state (seasonDetail, itemDetail)
  - Modal handlers
  - Render logic using extracted components

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** HIGH (completes refactoring)
**Risk:** HIGH (integration point - requires thorough testing)

---

## Similar Refactorings Needed

### Priority 2: settings-client.tsx (1,271 LOC)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Hotspot Score:** 42.54
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

### Priority 3: dashboard.ts API Route (1,117 LOC)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Hotspot Score:** 55.93
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

### Priority 4: Other Large Files (6 files over 800 LOC)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks total

---

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Phase:

1. **Type Check:** `pnpm typecheck` must pass
2. **Lint:** `pnpm lint` must pass
3. **Build:** `pnpm build` must succeed
4. **Manual Test:** Navigate to library page and test:
   - Loading library items
   - Filtering by service/instance/status/file
   - Searching items
   - Viewing item details
   - Managing seasons/episodes
   - Monitoring toggle
   - Search actions

### Before Committing:

- ‚úÖ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ‚úÖ No lint warnings introduced
- ‚úÖ App runs without console errors
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert specific commits: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. Feature flag approach: Keep old code temporarily with `USE_LEGACY_LIBRARY` flag
3. Gradual rollout: Test in staging before production

- Other 6 files: 48-72 hours

**Total:** 95-143 hours (~12-18 working days)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Complete library-client.tsx refactoring** before starting others
   - Finish all 6 phases
   - Document lessons learned
   - Create reusable patterns

2. **Update imports in library-client.tsx** to use new utility files
   - Replace local constants with imports from library-constants
   - Replace local utils with imports from library-utils
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Create refactoring template** based on library-client.tsx experience
   - Reuse for settings-client.tsx and dashboard.ts
   - Establish consistent patterns

### Long-term Strategy:

1. **Weekly refactoring sessions:** Dedicate 4-6 hours per week
2. **Pair programming:** Complex refactorings benefit from two sets of eyes
3. **Code review:** All refactorings should be reviewed before merging
4. **Feature freeze:** Consider pausing new features during major refactorings

## Notes & Learnings

### Phase 1 Learnings:
- ‚úÖ Utility extraction is straightforward and low-risk
- ‚úÖ Clear dependencies make extraction easier
- ‚úÖ JSDoc comments improve reusability
- üìù Consider creating barrel exports for cleaner imports

### Blockers:
- None currently

### Questions:
- Should we add unit tests for utilities before proceeding?
- Do we need to maintain backward compatibility during refactoring?
- Should extracted components go in same directory or separate subdirectories?
